# LumaGlass — engineering handoff

Everything a person or model needs to pick this project up cold: how the mod
works, what was measured on the set, which approaches are dead and why, and
how to measure again. Facts here were observed on one set unless marked
[INFERENCE]. Credentials and the set's address are deliberately absent; they
live with the owner.

## The rule that must not be broken

https://rootmy.tv/warning — **never write to the kernel, rootfs or tvservice
partitions.** A set bricked that way is not recoverable in software.

Everything this project does stays inside that boundary, deliberately:

- Only bind mounts and files under `/var` (writable ext4) and
  `/media/developer`. Never a raw write to a block device.
- The single exception is `snapshot-boot-manager --remove`, which clears the
  hibernation image on `mmcblk0p54`. That is LG's own tool on its own
  scratch partition, the kernel rebuilds the image on the next boot, and the
  worst case is one slow cold boot. It is not a firmware partition.
- `/usr`, `/etc`, `/lib` and `/mnt` are read-only overlays with lowerdir only
  and cannot be written even as root, which is why the mod shadows the
  compositor module and bind-mounts over Home's assets instead of editing
  them in place.
- No firmware flashing, no `dd` to `mmcblk0*`, no epk handling.

If a future change needs a partition write, stop and reconsider the design.

## The set

- LG OLED65C4PUA, model code `o22n2`, webOS 10.2.1, firmware 33.22.52, MediaTek
  (`chip=O22A3`), 2 GB RAM, armv7 userspace (`GLIBC_2.28`).
- Rooted with Homebrew Channel. SSH root login via Homebrew Channel's sshd; no
  passwordless sudo, the login is root. `luna-send` from a non-PTY SSH exec
  hangs — allocate a PTY. `journalctl` hangs — read `/var/log/messages`
  (monotonic timestamps in brackets), which rotates within minutes.
- A plain `reboot` returns powered on and is safe to drive over SSH. The luna
  `machineReboot` drops to standby and does not power back on. Wake-on-LAN
  works with `wolwowlOnOff` on (built-in LAN port), so a set in standby or
  fully off can be woken with a magic packet.
- `/sys/power/mode` reads `resume` on a normal boot and `making` on a boot
  that rebuilds the hibernation image.
- Screen capture: `luna://com.webos.service.capture/executeOneShot` with
  `{"path":"/tmp/x.png","method":"DISPLAY","format":"PNG","width":960,"height":540}`,
  then sftp the file. A blank panel returns ~835 bytes at 320x180.

## What the mod is

Two halves, one owner each.

- Compositor: a full shadow copy of the `WebOSCompositor` QML module (318
  files) at `/var/lib/lumaglass/qml`, with `StarfishFullscreenContainer.qml`
  swapped for ours (glass, wallpaper, widgets). `surface-manager-daemon.service`
  has `EnvironmentFile=-/var/systemd/system/env/surface-manager.env`; the mod
  writes `QML2_IMPORT_PATH=/var/lib/lumaglass/qml:/usr/lib/qt5/qml` there.
  `/usr` is a lowerdir-only overlay and can never be written.
- Home: `mount --bind /var/lib/lumaglass/assets` over
  `/usr/palm/applications/com.webos.app.home/data/flutter_assets/assets`
  (decluttered `home.xml`, strings, blank hero banners), then relaunch Home.
  A bind does not survive a reboot.

State lives in `/var/lib/lumaglass/`; the CLI is `tools/lumaglass`, the boot
worker is `tools/autostart.sh`. `status` is the source of truth for what is
live.

## Boot: the proven mechanism

The set does not cold-boot from standby. `/proc/cmdline` carries
`snapshot resume=/dev/mmcblk0p54`, boot status reports
`snapshot-resume-done: true`, and the compositor restored from that image
carries the pid and start time it had when the image was made. A "first
start" of the compositor is therefore a memory restore, and systemd
timestamps read on a resumed boot are values baked into the image, not this
boot's.

On a genuine cold boot (`mode=making`), measured:

| event | monotonic |
| :--- | ---: |
| `mount-dynamic-partition.service` | 1.07–1.32 s |
| `ls-hubd` ExecMainStart | 1.32 s |
| `var.mount` (p58 on /var) active | 1.98 s |
| `surface-manager-daemon` ExecMainStart | 2.63 s |
| `sam.service` | 5.28 s |
| `mount-readwrite.service` active | 10.8–13.1 s |
| `kdump.service` ExecMainStart | 12.1–14.3 s |
| image capture (making boot) | ~15 s |
| Home first paint | ~12–18 s |
| Homebrew Channel `init.d` run-parts | ~33 s |

The compositor's first start can never load the modded QML, and the reason is
the filesystem, not ordering. Until `mount-readwrite.service` relocates it,
`/var` does not show the writable ext4 subtree, so `/var/systemd/system/env`
is not a path that exists yet; the daemon's optional `EnvironmentFile` read at
2.63 s is a silent no-op. Proof:

- The env file's atime, set to 2020 before a cold boot, was untouched after it.
- Marker variables planted in `ls-hubd.env`, `configd.env`, `memchute.env`,
  `tvpowerd.env`, `bootd.env` and `sam.env` were absent from every one of
  those processes' `/proc/<pid>/environ`. LG's own env files are inert that
  early too.
- `/var` is a subtree mount (`mountinfo` root `/var` on p58).
  `/var/systemd/system/env/surface-manager.env` and
  `/mnt/lg/cmn_data/var/systemd/system/env/surface-manager.env` are the same
  inode; `/mnt/lg/cmn_data/systemd` does not exist. A copy staged at p58's
  root was not read either, so the early `/var` is the firmware overlay
  (which holds only `lib`), not any view of p58.

Consequences: one compositor restart per boot is structural, ~13 s is the
floor for anything a root mod can do, and every restart after ~13 s picks the
env file up reliably.

### The early hook

Homebrew Channel's run-parts fires at ~33 s, after Home has painted, which
produced the stock-Home-then-blink-then-mod sequence. The mod now triggers
from `kdump.service`: it starts at 12–14 s, reads
`/var/systemd/system/env/kdump.env`, and its script's first act is a bare
`grep`. `persist on` writes `PATH=/var/lib/lumaglass/earlybin:...` into that
env file and a shim named `grep` into `earlybin` that starts the worker once
per boot and then `exec /bin/grep "$@"`. On a set without `crashkernel` on
the kernel command line the script is a no-op that exits 0, and the unit is
`Restart=no`. The shim uses absolute paths throughout (a bare `grep` inside
it would re-enter itself) and launches the worker with a plain PATH. The late
hook stands down when `/tmp/.lumaglass-worker` names a live pid or the boot
completed.

### Readiness

`systemctl is-active`, the Home process, `NL_HOME_SHOWN` and
`getForegroundAppInfo` all go true ~8 s before anything is composited. The
only honest gate is the panel: `executeOneShot` at 320x180 returns 835 bytes
while blank and >79000 once Home is up. Measured after a restart: content at
+12 s, and asking for Home at +4 s does not delay it. The old sequence slept
14 s before launching Home and 8 s after; both sleeps are gone. The gate is
bounded at 30 s, and on the boot path a timeout is not an error (a boot into
standby never presents).

### Result

Wake from cold, frame-captured every 2 s (`evidence/boot/`): live TV at 12 s
(the image's restored state), black from ~17 s (our restart pre-empts Home's
first paint), modded home fully formed at 33–36 s. Previously ~55–60 s with a
stock-Home phase in between. Whether Home paints before the restart lands is
a race that varies by a second or two per boot.

## Standby: the proven mechanism

After power-off the set enters active standby (RAM alive) within ~3.4 s. A
power-on from there is instant with the mod still on screen. What made it go
cold was `faultmanager`: at power-off it scans
`/tmp/var/log/reports/librdx`, and any report there makes it answer
`responseSuspendRequest` with `ack:false, reason:"rebootToSuspend",
rebootReason:"rebootByFault"`; tvpowerd then reboots ~6 s after entering
standby. Captured on the bus with
`ls-monitor -f com.webos.service.tvpower` written to `/var` (not `/tmp`,
which does not survive the reboot).

Two reports were arming it.

1. The compositor restart makes `com.webos.app.inputcommon` segfault on
   teardown (`QFontDatabase::removeAllApplicationFonts`), landing ~3 s after
   the restart. The sweep meant to remove it never worked: it read names back
   from `ls`, which word-splits on the spaces every name contains and prints
   the 0x02 bytes rdxd uses in place of `/` as `?`; `rm -f` on those names
   was a no-op counted as success. The sweep now uses pathname expansion
   (raw bytes) and runs again once Home is back on the panel.
2. `webos-sddp` (Control4 discovery) segfaults in `SDDPSetDevice` (NULL
   dereference, backtrace `main → start_sddp → SDDPStart → SDDPSetDevice`)
   whenever it reads the interface list and finds a point-to-point interface
   carrying the multicast flag: the Tailscale `tun` (`/32`, no broadcast) on
   the reference set. Proven both ways: with `tailscaled` stopped it starts
   and stays active; with the tunnel present it dies within 3 s of
   `systemctl start`. A stock set has no such interface. At boot it starts at
   ~42 s, before Tailscale's hook (which sleeps 30 s) creates the tunnel, so
   it survives until the first wake re-reads interfaces - which is why it
   first looked like a wake crash. Not this mod's and not LG's for normal
   customers. Its script is gated on the set's own `enableSDDP` setting, so
   the **Instant on** toggle (`standby warm`) turns that off and Quick
   Start+ on, remembering the previous value; `standby cold` restores it and
   turns Quick Start+ off. Removing Tailscale from the set would make the
   SDDP part unnecessary.

   Nothing else on the set is affected by the tunnel: `avahi-daemon`
   (AirPlay/HomeKit), `chromecast-provisioning`, `miracast`, `appcasting`,
   `connman` all active; no faultmanager detections; no crashd or rdxd
   history; the three failed units (`broadcast-configd`, `f2io-on`, `gibbs`)
   are tuner one-shots that fail at 12-18 s, before the tunnel exists.

   Tailscale was removed from the set on 2026-09-14 (node logged out, daemon,
   init.d hook and `/media/developer/tailscale` deleted). Remote terminal
   access goes through the Unraid node's subnet routes instead; nothing on
   the set depends on a tunnel any more, and `enableSDDP` is off only because
   the Instant on toggle sets it.

Measured after both: three power-off / wake cycles of 150 s each with no
reboot, uptime carrying across, the same compositor still running, and Home
from a warm wake painting in 8 s (`evidence/home-after-warm-wake.png`).

Related facts from `tvpowerd`: `com.webos.service.tvpower.instantBootRefreshPeriod`
is 24 (hours) via configd, after which a warm set is refreshed cold once
("Wait for 1 Minute at active standby" then "Go to Cold"). There is a
`warmOwner` / `registerActiveStandbyRequest` protocol
(`{"clientName","timestamp","ack"}` responses) and a learned power-off
history at `/mnt/lg/cmn_data/tvpower/webos_offhistory`; neither needed
touching.

## Tried and dead

- **Baking the mod into the hibernation image.** LG's own remake path is
  `snapshot-boot-manager --remove` then `reboot`; the next boot comes up
  `mode=making` and the kernel writes a fresh image to p54 (250 MB
  partition). Safe — worst case one cold boot, as after a firmware update —
  and exercised several times. It cannot carry the mod: the image is captured
  at ~15 s, before the 13 s floor plus a restart can finish, so the resumed
  compositor is always stock and the asset bind is absent. `snap_list` has no
  Home/sam entry, and `-m` from a live desktop would not fit against ~1.2 GB
  in use.
- **Staging the env file on p58's root** so the early `/var` would see it:
  not read (see above).
- **A unit drop-in or a `/run/systemd/system` unit**: `/etc` and `/usr` are
  read-only overlays; `/run` is writable but volatile and nothing early can
  populate it.
- **Making the restart cheaper**: the 12–16 s from restart to pixels is the
  compositor's cold start plus Home's cold start (`surface-manager.sh` kills
  every client on restart), not padding.

## The other mod on this set

tvweb (`nphil/lg-webos-mqtt`) bind-mounts its own adblock `/etc/hosts`. That
bind stacks on top of Homebrew Channel's, which is how Homebrew's OS-update
block (four LG hosts pointed at loopback) was silently defeated: the TV found
a 1.7 GB firmware update and put its NSU alert up at boot+34 s for 30 s on
every boot. tvweb 0.34.3 carries those hosts whenever
`/var/luna/preferences/webosbrew_block_updates` exists.

tvweb used to offer QML screen saver replacements. They are gone as of tvweb
0.35.0, and the reason is worth keeping because it applies to any webOS 10
set.

The community mechanism (`webosbrew/custom-screensaver` and forks such as
`aabytt/custom-screensaver-aerial`) is a **single-file** bind:

    mount --bind our.qml /usr/palm/applications/com.webos.app.screensaver/qml/main.qml

Nothing else is touched, so the app SAM scanned is unchanged: no type change,
no SAM restart, and a boot hook re-applying it is enough. It works because on
webOS 5 to 23 the stock screen saver is a QML app - exactly the compatibility
range those projects advertise.

webOS 10 rewrote it in Flutter. The app directory holds `appinfo.json` with
`"type": "flutter"`, `data/flutter_assets/` and `lib/libapp.so`, and there is
no `qml/` directory at all, so aerial's own `apply.sh` exits "Target file does
not exist" here. tvweb's screen savers descended from that lineage, which is
why they never ran: every launch failed "Unable to start engine without AOT
data" and exited 85 ms later, and after a few of those tvpower refused all
further requests (`InvalidStatechangeRequest`) until a power cycle - the set
showed no screen saver at all. That, not the compositor widgets, was the cause
of "the screen saver never kicks in".

Rejected alternatives, all tested on the set:

- Binding our own directory over the whole app with a QML `appinfo.json` does
  run, but only after SAM re-reads the app type, which it caches at its boot
  scan (5s) while any writable filesystem arrives at ~13s. `systemctl restart
  sam` forces it and works, at the cost of a dropped Home and an `eim` crash
  whose report makes faultmanager reboot the set at the next power-off. It
  would also need repeating every boot.
- A copy under `/media/developer/apps` or `/media/cryptofs/apps` with the same
  app id is ignored: SAM dedupes by id and the system copy wins. Confirmed on
  two cold boots.

With stock restored, LG's idle detector `com.webos.service.nop` calls
`power2/turnOnScreenSaver` exactly 180 s after the last input and the stock app
stays up. Idle time is 3 minutes; `screenSaverTime` is not a settingsservice
key on this firmware. A Flutter build of our own would be the only native route
and was not attempted.

## Compositor restart side effects still worth knowing

A bare `systemctl restart surface-manager-daemon` on stock firmware, no mod,
makes stock apps segfault on teardown. `faultmanager`'s policy is in
`/etc/faultmanager/faultconf.json`; `getFaultStatus` lists what it has seen.
The mod removes only the reports its own restart produced.

## Measuring again

- Cold boot on demand: `snapshot-boot-manager --remove; reboot` (expect the
  "making" splash once). Normal reboot: `reboot`.
- Whether the first compositor is stock: its `/proc/<pid>/environ`
  `QML2_IMPORT_PATH`, and `awk '{print int($22/100)}' /proc/<pid>/stat` for
  its start second.
- Panel timeline during boot: a background loop calling `executeOneShot`
  every 2 s from the early shim, recording `writtenBytes`; frames in
  `evidence/boot/` came from that.
- Standby: `ls-monitor -f com.webos.service.tvpower > /var/lib/lumaglass/x.log`
  before `luna://com.webos.service.tvpower/power2/powerOff
  '{"reason":"remoteKey"}'`; wake with a WoL packet; compare `/proc/uptime`
  before and after. SSH survives active standby.

## Research

`research/home-launcher-replacements.md` surveys other rooted-webOS home
replacements and the input-hook tooling around them; it informed the choice
to mod the compositor and Home in place rather than launch over them.

Prior art worth reading before designing anything new:

- `webosbrew/custom-screensaver` and its fork
  `aabytt/custom-screensaver-aerial` — the single-file bind over
  `qml/main.qml`, and the cleanest example of modding a stock app without
  touching what SAM scanned. Its compatibility stopping at webOS 23 is the
  tell that LG changed the app's runtime.
- `webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel` — the root elevation, the `init.d`
  runner this mod hooks, the failsafe flag, and the `/etc/hosts` update
  block.
- `openlgtv` — firmware archaeology rather than runtime modding:
  `epk2extract` unpacks LG firmware images (useful for reading a stock app or
  binary from a newer release without owning that set), plus buildroot trees
  and `nsu_emu`, an update-server emulator. Nothing needed for this project,
  but it is where to look when a question is "what changed in firmware X".
