# LG settings → LumaShell sections

Source: LG's Settings app for this C4 (`com.palm.app.settings`, copied to
`/data/home/lgtv/research/lgsettings/`). The item names below are the English
source strings in `main.js` (`Up("…")` calls and the `rV` panel map);
`res/en/GB/strings.json` only holds the British overrides (Colour, Programme).
Network, Family Settings and the LG account live in separate sub-apps and are
not in this bundle; they are marked *(sub-app)*.

LG's top level is Picture · Sound · General · Support, with roughly 130 items
below. LumaShell shows nine sections. Each section keeps the few items a person
changes from the sofa, worded plainly, and ends with a "More in LG settings"
row that opens LG's own screen (themed) for the rest.

## Live lines on the rail

Picture "Filmmaker · Pixel brightness 80" · Sound "Denon AVR-S760H · eARC" ·
Inputs & devices "HDMI 2 · 3 connected" · Network "Nate's Home · Strong" ·
Ambient light "Follows the picture" · Home & look "Dynamic tint ·
Aurora" · Remote & pointer "Pointer on · Normal speed" · AI access "LAN only · 2
assistants" (or "Off") · System "Up to date · webOS 10.2.1". Each reads the
owner's current value, as LumaShow's `settings/summary.rs` does.
