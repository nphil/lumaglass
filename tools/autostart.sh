# LumaGlass boot hook.
#
# Symlinked to /var/lib/webosbrew/init.d/50-lumaglass by `lumaglass persist on`
# and run by Homebrew Channel's startup.sh via run-parts during boot.
#
# Two hard rules, because this runs on the boot path:
#
#   1. It must ALWAYS exit 0. A non-zero exit from an init.d hook can trip
#      Homebrew Channel's failsafe mode, which disables every root
#      customization on the next boot and shows the user a crash toast. A
#      cosmetic mod is never worth that, so every failure here is logged and
#      swallowed.
#   2. It must never block boot indefinitely. Every wait is bounded and the
#      whole run is capped.
#
# The hook is also a no-op unless the user explicitly asked for persistence,
# so removing the symlink is not the only off switch.

# Everything below runs DETACHED, and that is the whole point.
#
# Homebrew Channel's startup.sh arms a failsafe flag, runs these hooks with
# run-parts, then clears the flag ~10s later. A hook that blocks holds that
# window open for as long as it runs: if the set powers off before the flag is
# cleared, the next boot comes up in failsafe mode with every root
# customization disabled. Applying inline took ~45s, so an overnight power-off
# landed inside the window and did exactly that.
#
# So: return to run-parts immediately and do the work in a detached child.
# startup.sh closes the lock fd for children (`run-parts ... 200>&-`), so the
# child cannot hold Homebrew Channel's startup lock either.
