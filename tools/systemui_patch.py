"""Patches a staged copy of LG's Quick Settings into the LumaGlass look and
opening behaviour.

Two kinds of change:

  * Behaviour. Stock rebuilds the whole panel on every open, and the build
    blocks the open transition - measured as one frozen frame of 236-357ms
    where the panel's own 180ms pause and 150ms slide should have run, so the
    menu snapped into place instead of sliding. A panel that has completed its
    data pass is kept instead, with its subscriptions live, and a re-open is
    the transition only: on screen in 169ms with no frame over 20ms.

  * Look. LG's flat slab and grey cards become the same dark glass as the rest
    of LumaGlass: one static gradient, a hairline along the lit edge, rounded
    where the panel faces the screen. Nothing here samples what is behind it,
    so the cost is the same handful of quads whatever is playing underneath.

Every edit is anchored to an exact fragment of LG's source. A missing anchor is
fatal: a half-patched panel is worse than an unpatched one, and a firmware
update that rewrites these files must fail loudly here rather than silently
ship a broken menu.

usage: systemui_patch.py <staged QuickSettings dir>
Runs on the set (python 3.10). Called by tools/lumaglass; see systemui_stage.
